Step 1: Basics of Python

Why: NLP is mostly done in Python. You need solid Python skills.

Topics to Cover:

Data types, loops, functions

File handling

Regular expressions (important for text processing)

Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets)

Resources:

Automate the Boring Stuff with Python (book)

Python tutorials on YouTube or freeCodeCamp

Step 2: Basics of NLP

Goal: Understand text preprocessing and basic NLP tasks.

Topics:

Tokenization (splitting text into words or sentences)

Stop words removal

Stemming and Lemmatization

Bag-of-Words & TF-IDF

Libraries: NLTK, spaCy

Project Ideas:

Word frequency counter

Simple text classification (e.g., spam vs. ham emails)

Step 3: Data Handling & Visualization

Goal: Learn to handle datasets for NLP.

Topics:

Reading text files, CSVs

Using pandas for data manipulation

Visualizing text (word clouds, frequency plots)

Project Ideas:

Analyze a dataset of reviews (positive/negative)

Plot most frequent words in a corpus

Step 4: Intermediate NLP (Classical ML)

Goal: Apply machine learning to text.

Topics:

Feature extraction (TF-IDF, CountVectorizer)

Text classification (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)

Sentiment analysis

Libraries: scikit-learn

Project Ideas:

Movie review sentiment analysis

Email spam detection

Step 5: Deep Learning NLP

Goal: Learn modern NLP using deep learning.

Topics:

Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)

RNNs, LSTMs for sequence modeling

Attention mechanism and Transformers

Libraries: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers

Project Ideas:

Text generation (like GPT mini)

Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Question-Answering system

Step 6: Large Language Models (LLMs)

Goal: Work with state-of-the-art NLP models.

Topics:

Pre-trained models (BERT, GPT, T5)

Fine-tuning for specific tasks

Text summarization, translation

Libraries: transformers (Hugging Face)

Project Ideas:

Chatbot with GPT-like behavior

Automatic summarizer for articles

Domain-specific QA system

Step 7: NLP Projects for Portfolio

Sentiment analysis on tweets

Fake news detection

Question-answering chatbot

Text summarization of news articles

Named entity recognition for medical texts

Tip: Start small, finish mini-projects, and gradually move to deep learning and LLMs.
